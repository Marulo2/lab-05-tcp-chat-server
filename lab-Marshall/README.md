## Welcome to a simple IRC server!

Getting started is a little clumsy but it's simple enough:

To test functionality, please make your way in the terminal to lab-5-tcp-chat-server/lab-Marshall and run 'node server.js' to start up the server on port 3000.

Open up two more terminals and run 'telnet localhost 3000' in each terminal to connect to the local server.

Then, you should be able to begin testing chat functionality between the two local connections by typing anything you wish into the command line!
